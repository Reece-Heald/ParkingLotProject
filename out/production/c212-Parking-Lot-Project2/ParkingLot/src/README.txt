READ ME:
Our Parking lot Program is a console driven program.
To use the program run SystemDriver.java, this will prompt the user with:
    Welcome to the Parking Lot System!
    Press L to Login, R to Register a new User, or Q to quit.

New users will want to register.
A prompt for a username and password will appear, already taken usernames will return an error to the console and
request a new username.
This functions for customers to register, admins and stewards cannot register this way.
From each menu, depending on what role you take, you are prompted with possible actions.
To save data make sure to exit via "Q", data will not be saved otherwise.
